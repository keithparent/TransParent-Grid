TransParent Grid
================

A highly flexible, extremely powerful, fluid and responsive grid system. Not limited to the standard 12 column format, it has a variable amount of columns per row.

The keys to best-practice in effectively utilizing the grid:

Basic Usage

'.container': the outermost wrapper — it sets the overall width for all display sizes,
'.row-*': where '*' is equal to the number of columns a grid row will have,
'.col-*': where '*' is equal to the number of columns a column counts for of the grid row columns.

Separate the structure from the skin

Don't add the grid classes to existing mark-up — add new mark-up to apply the grid,
Don't stack other classes to the grid mark-up — unless you know exactly what you are doing, and…
Don't overlap grid classes — don't add a 'row-*' class to mark-up that already has a 'col-*' class.

Compatibility: the TransParent Grid uses the border-box box-sizing method, so it is compatible with all modern browsers (i.e. not compatible with IE7 and less). Works perfect in Chrome, IE8+, FF, Opera, and Safari.

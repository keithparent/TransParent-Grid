It has a variable amount of columns per row ranging anywhere from 1 to 16.\r\n\r\nThe keys to best-practice in effectively utilizing the grid:\r\n\r\nBasic Usage\r\n\r\n'.container': the outermost wrapper — it sets the overall width for all display sizes,\r\n'.row-*': where '*' is equal to the number of columns a grid row will have,\r\n'.col-*': where '*' is equal to the number of columns a column counts for of the grid row columns.\r\n\r\nSeparate the structure from the skin\r\n\r\nDon't add the grid classes to existing mark-up — add new mark-up to apply the grid,\r\nDon't stack other classes to the grid mark-up — unless you know exactly what you are doing, and…\r\nDon't overlap grid classes — don't add a 'row-*' class to mark-up that already has a 'col-*' class.\r\n\r\nCompatibility: the TransParent Grid uses the border-box box-sizing method, so it is not compatible with IE7 and down. Otherwise, it should work in most other modern browsers (Chrome, FF, Opera, and Safari).\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\"Good design is obvious.
